# room

For air at normal conditions (around 20°C and atmospheric pressure), we can use an approximate specific heat capacity of 1005 J/(kg·°C).

To find out how much 100W can warm up the air in the room, we'll have to make some assumptions:

    Assume the density of air is approximately 1.2 kg/m³.
    Calculate the mass of air in the room: mass = density * volume.

Let's calculate step by step.

Given:

    Power (P) = 100 W (J/s)
    Volume (V) = 30 m³
    Specific heat capacity (c) = 1005 J/(kg·°C)
    Density of air (ρ) = 1.2 kg/m³ (approximately)

First, find the mass of the air in the room:

mass = density \* volume = 1.2 \* 30 = 36 kg.

Now, we can rearrange the formula Q = mcΔT to solve for the temperature change (ΔT):

Q = mcΔT
ΔT = Q / (mc)

We know Q = Pt, where t is the time in seconds. As the power is in watts, we need to convert it to joules, so t must be in seconds.

t = 30 \* 60 = 1800 seconds.

Q = 100 \* 1800 = 180000 J.

Now plug in the values:

ΔT = 180000 / (36 \* 1005) = 5 °C.

So, a 100W heat source will warm up the 30m³ room by approximately 5°C, assuming the room is filled with normal air.
